# DNS — Resolution Flow and Resolver Role

## What Is a DNS Resolver?

A DNS resolver is the component that answers "what is the IP (or other record) for this name?"

There are two common resolver roles:

- **Stub resolver** (on host/OS): minimal client that forwards queries.
- **Recursive resolver** (in network): performs full lookup by querying other nameservers and caching results.

When people say "DNS resolver" in production architecture, they usually mean the **recursive resolver**.

## End-to-End Resolution (Typical)

1. App asks OS for `www.example.com`.
2. OS checks local sources (browser cache, OS cache, `/etc/hosts`).
3. On miss, OS stub sends query to configured recursive resolver.
4. Recursive resolver checks its cache.
5. On miss, recursive resolver asks a root server for `.com` delegation.
6. Resolver asks `.com` TLD server for `example.com` delegation.
7. Resolver asks authoritative server for `www.example.com` record.
8. Authoritative server replies (e.g. CNAME -> A/AAAA chain).
9. Recursive resolver caches each RRset by TTL and returns final answer to client.

## Query Types: Recursive vs Iterative

- **Recursive query**: Client asks resolver "give me final answer".
- **Iterative query**: Resolver asks nameservers and gets referrals until it reaches authority.

## Why Recursive Resolvers Are Critical

- Reduce latency through shared cache hits.
- Protect authoritative servers from repeated traffic.
- Apply policy/security (DNSSEC validation, filtering, split-horizon rules).
- Improve resilience using retries and alternate upstream paths.

## Failure Scenarios to Understand

- Resolver unavailable: apps fail to resolve names quickly.
- Stale cache after change: traffic may continue to old endpoint until TTL expiry.
- Bad delegation (NS/glue mismatch): domain partially or fully unresolvable.
